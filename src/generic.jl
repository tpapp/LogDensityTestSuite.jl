"""
Abstract type for convenient dispatch.

**Not part of the API**, takes care of the following defaults:

1. `hypercube_dimension` falls back to `dimension`,

2. `logdensity` works through `logdensity_and_gradient` (inefficient, but should not matter)

3. `rand` is implemented via `hypercube_transform`.
"""
abstract type SamplingLogDensity end

"""
$(SIGNATURES)

Dimension for the second argument argument [`hypercube_transform`].

Falls back to `dimension` for `SamplingLogDensity`, since only mixtures need to override it.

Mostly for internal use, see [`samples`](@ref).
"""
hypercube_dimension(ℓ::SamplingLogDensity) = dimension(ℓ)

logdensity(ℓ::SamplingLogDensity, x) = first(logdensity_and_gradient(ℓ, x))

"""
$(FUNCTIONNAME)(ℓ, x)

Transform ``x ∈ [0,1]ⁿ`` into a random variable that has the given distribution when `x` is
uniform on the given hypercube, where `n` is `hypercube_dimension(ℓ)`.

The result needs to be distinct from `x`, as that is a buffer that may be reused.

Mostly for internal use, see [`samples`](@ref).
